## Implementing a Simple Combinational Circuit on FPGA

We have implemented a simple combinational circuit on our FPGA. This involves assigning I/O pins to our modules for synthesizing the designs on the FPGA. We have also use Vivado to burn our System Verilog code onto the FPGA.

### Steps to Follow

1. **Design the System Verilog Code:** Implement the logic equation in System Verilog.

2. **Assign I/O Pins:** Map inputs and outputs to FPGA pins.

3. **Synthesize the Design:** Use Vivado to synthesize and implement the design.
 
4. **Design the testbench system verilog code:** Use code editor to write the test bench code and add it with the rtl file in a folder.

5. **Test bench on Modelsim:** Upload the folder on the Model sim and simuate bench file after compiling.

6. **Program the FPGA:** Burn the rtl System Verilog code onto the FPGA.

### Tools Required

- Xilinx Vivado Design 

- FPGA Development Board (NEXYS-A7)

- USB Programming Cable
 
- Model Sim
